# Motivation
I'm trying to achieve a setup that makes the default neovim behavior smoother, rather than depending too much on plugins' feature. Note that this setup is also designed to work without using lsp features with c/cpp.

Features like fzf, leap etc is too useful not to have :)

# Todos
- [ ] Refactor language specific setups
- [x] Make nvim-tree and oil interacts with each other
- [ ] Remove unused features
- [ ] Design a bufferized runner that only does 1 run 2 async
